# hello-world
This is the new and final revision of this text

I'm learning about revisions and how they branch off the master.
Once I save this it will be considered a "commit"
Below I need to comment what and why I've made changes

First go and create a new branch

Then go and edit and confirm that new branch

then send it out to be discussed and edited

Once completed to the merge and delete the branch
